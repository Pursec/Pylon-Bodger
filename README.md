# Pylon-Bodger
Arma 3 GUI for "bodging" pylon loadouts with incompatible magazines/weapons on the fly featuring:

* Zeus module, ZEN context menu, and ACE Zeus interaction, to call upon the Pylon Bodger UI
* Dynamic loading of pylons based on current modset - all magazines that specify a pylon weapon will be added into the list
* Fully functional searchbar to find what pylons you want quickly, will show any listed pylon that contains the substring you enter and even ignores spaces + dashes to ease searching
* Multiple slot selection for modifying more than one Pylon on the fly
* Toggle for changing pylon slot ownership to pilot or gunner
* Export tools to export the current loadout for use on a vehicles initialization on mission start, or for use being called as a script/function at anytime


* SOON: Saving and loading system of loadouts to let you save your favorites and then load them again exactly the same quickly
* SOON: Ability to allow certain players to use the bodger mid-game without going through zeus, editable by the Curator - who will be able to by default.
